# Zip Command

This is a command that you can use in any Terminal or CLI without any application. With the keyword "zip" you are capable of:

- Reading the items inside a Zip file.
- Rapid extracting of a Zip file wherever you want.
- Creating a new Zip file with just three words, so easy.

# How to use it?

First, donwload the zip file of this repository, then (this will be so ironic) you have to extract it or just download every file one by one (No one will do this but is an alternative, lol). When you finally have the archives, you have to do the following:

## Windows (7, 8, 10)

##### 1 | Open the search bar and type "Edit the system environment variables" and click the button "Environment variables".

##### 2 | Once you clicked it, a new window will appear, in that window you will have two different parts called "User variables for administrador" and "System variables".

##### 3 | In the second one, scroll down until you encounter the variable called "Path", right click on it and then click the button "Edit".

##### 4 | Another window will appear and finally you have to click in one blank field and paste right there de direction of the file called "Zip.exe" where is located inside "Zip-Command\bin\Debug\net6.0\". (You have to paste the full path to the file or it won't work).

And there you have it!, Just open your terminal and type some command like "zip -R "Downloads/sample.zip".
